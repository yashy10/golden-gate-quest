Its interior houses Reverend Roland Gordon’s monumental collage-mural, The Great Cloud of Witnesses, which documents the church and community at large, along with local, national, and international Black history. A work in progress since 1980, it has become the largest mural of its kind in the United States and serves as an unparalleled visual record of African-American religion, culture and history. With its tripartite composition, symmetrically composed façade, dentiled cornice, and centrally located, full-height portico capped with a pediment and supported by Ionic columns and pilasters, the Ingleside Presbyterian Church illustrates the distinctive characteristics of the Neoclassical style as designed by master Architect Joseph Leonard. The interior of the church houses  a collage-mural entitled The Great Cloud of Witnesses, which consists of newspaper and magazine clippings, posters, framed prints, and painted murals that have been pasted to the walls of all three levels. What began as Reverend Gordon's simple mission to provide images of role models to the community's youth has resulted in an awe-inspiring Folk Artist Environment that greatly contributes to the body of American and African American Folk Art and serves as an extraordinary, unparalleled visual documentation of national and San-Francisco-specific African American history."

Coleman Medical Center is significant for its association with Dr. Arthur H. Coleman, a nationally prominent African American lawyer-physician and influential healthcare and civil rights advocate. Dr. Coleman purchased the property at 6301 Third Street to construct a purpose-built medical facility to serve Bayview residents. Opening in 1960, the Arthur H. Coleman Medical Center reflected the popular architectural styles of the period, and served as a modern symbol of community health, progress, and success. He recruited a team of African American physicians to join him in his vision of providing comprehensive health services to the area’s low-income African American residents.

Designed by architect Charles Wilson, it originally housed Chemical Engine No. 2. In 1900, Engine 22 was transferred here and later played an important role in responding to the 1906 Earthquake and Fire. The Company spent 45 hours assisting in the evacuation of patients from Park Emergency Hospital and checking for flames as far east as Hyde Street and as far north as Sacramento Street. The fire house also served as a food distribution center in the disaster’s aftermath. Though it ceased operating in 1962, the building’s wide double doors and tall hose drying tower still attest to its long firefighting history."

The theater is considered the flagship theater of the Nasser Family, San Francisco’s oldest movie business family. An early work of renowned Bay Area architect Timothy Pflueger, the Castro Theatre was the first theater he designed and is considered one of his most iconic pieces of work. The theater anchored early commercial development in the Eureka Valley neighborhood, now known as the Castro. Since the mid-1970s, the Castro Theatre has maintained a deep tradition of LGBTQ programming, including the world’s largest and longest-running LGBTQ film festival. Countless independent movies have premiered at the theater, drawing global attention to diverse topics surrounding LGBTQ identity, culture, history, politics, and more."

It is also associated with the experience of the Japanese community in San Francisco during World War II and following the signing of Executive Order No. 9066 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942. The building was used as a processing center where citizens and non‐citizens of Japanese ancestry were required to report before being relocated to concentration camps across the country. The building is also significant for its association with community organizing and activism among African Americans in San Francisco during the twentieth century. The center provided African Americans, especially youth, with a space for social, educational, and recreational opportunities. Lastly, the building itself is an excellent example of an educational building designed in the Mediterranean Revival architectural style in San Francisco, a popular design aesthetic for school buildings during the 1920s and 1930s."

The “History of Medicine in California” frescoes consist of 12 panels (10 pictorial and 2 descriptive) depicting California medical history with vivid, diverse images of doctors, lab scientists, and other medical professionals, and of suffering and recovered patients. The mural cycle “The History of Medicine in California” is significant as an excellent example of New Deal-era mural artwork, displaying the distinctive characteristics of New Deal-era frescos with a consistent earth-toned palette, intense saturated colors, figurative content, rounded forms, and overall stylistic influence of the Mexican mural movement of the 1920s. “History of Medicine in California” is also significant as the work of by master artist and muralist, Bernard Zakheim. The “History of Medicine in California” is the largest, most immersive fresco buono work of Zakheim’s career and the last fresco commission the artist completed in San Francisco. The period of significance for the “History of Medicine in California” frescoes is 1936-1938."

Constructed largely to house itinerant and seasonal workers employed in nearby factories and industries along the waterfront, the hotel is emblematic of a pattern of the development in South of Market that began in the mid‐1800s and continued through the post‐1906 earthquake and fire reconstruction. The hotel is particularly notable for surviving the large‐scale redevelopment of South of Market during the mid-twentieth century during which much of the building stock, including nearly all the residential hotels, dating to the period when the neighborhood served as the city’s industrial and manufacturing center was razed. With its ornate millwork, rounded and angled bays, the Hotel Utah is also a striking example of Edwardian style architecture commonly employed in the design of residential hotel buildings constructed during the period."

Third Baptist Church has played an important role in promoting black community leadership as well as the social, economic, and political advancement of African Americans in San Francisco. Reverend Frederick Douglas Haynes Sr., emerged as a highly influential leader in San Francisco's civil rights movement and in 1945 was the first African American to run for a position on the Board of Supervisors. Although he never held office, in 1996, the subsequent pastor of Third Baptist Church, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown, became the city's second African American member of the Board of Supervisors. The property at 1399 McAllister Street is among several African American protestant churches constructed in San Francisco during the postwar period and one of the first churches in the city to brake from the traditional representations of ecclesiastical design with a new, simplified architectural expression that was thought to better articulate Protestant beliefs."

The first tenants were wine and liquor importers. Later tenants included tobacco dealers and a coffee mill. Despite its name, the caducei prominent at the top of the fluted pilasters are not associated with the medical profession. Rather, they are associated with the Greek god Hermes, protector of merchants and thieves. The building survived the Earthquake and Fire in 1906 thanks to its “fire-proof” brick construction."

Church), located at 2041 Larkin Street, is eligible for designation as a San
Francisco Landmark for association with significant cultural and historic
events, specifically, as the first avowedly inter-racial, inter-cultural, interdenominational
church in the United States, and for association with
significant persons, specifically, Dr. Howard Thurman and Sue Bailey
Thurman. Dr. Howard Thurman, one of the co-founders of The Church for
the Fellowship of All Peoples, was an internationally known theologian and
religious scholar, and one of the principle intellectual influences shaping the
modern, nonviolent civil rights movement. Sue Bailey Thurman, who
helped establish The Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples, was an
author, editor, lecturer, historian, and community organizer, renowned for
her efforts to integrate and progress the lives of Black women, for
dissemination of African American history, and for advocacy of interracial,
intercultural, and international understanding in support of universal
emancipation. The Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples is associated
with culturally and historically significant events and persons under the
thematic contexts of “African American Social and Cultural Institutions” and
“African Americans and the Political and Legal Landscape,” as outlined in
the African American Citywide Historic Context Statement (DRAFT), as a site
important for association with African American social, cultural, and
intellectual life, and as a property associated with the struggle for
integration and with prominent persons in the struggle for civil rights."

The stepped, 150‐foot tower, originally capped by an aircraft beacon, soars above the surrounding district. Named El Rey – ""The King"" in Spanish – the former theater, which was most recently used as a church, continues to be the neighborhood's foremost visual landmark. Timothy Pflueger, the architect of El Rey, is one of San Francisco's top architects of the twentieth century. El Rey is one of only three theaters in the city that retains its original Pflueger designed auditorium. Built to serve the new residence parks and streetcar suburbs of the fast‐growing West of Twin Peaks area, El Rey was perhaps the grandest of all the so‐called ""neighborhood theaters"" that proliferated along major commercial corridors in the city's outlying neighborhoods between the First and Second World Wars."

Constructed in 1931‐1932, the building represents the work of two master architects, Martin J. Rist and Alfred I. Coffey, both separately and in partnership were well known for their designs of institutional buildings, such as schools and hospitals. The University Mound Old Ladies' Home was founded in 1884 with a $100,000 bequest from James Lick, one of the wealthiest men in California at that time. It originally sat on 25 acres of land which was farmed to provide food for the elderly women of modest means who lived there. The University Mound Old Ladies' Home was in operation for 130 years until 2014 when it was sold to a new nursing home provider."

Octagon houses were a national fad in the mid-19th century, popularized by amateur architect and phrenologist Orson S. Fowler’s book, “A Home for All. The book argued the eight sided form was healthier because it maximized fresh air and sunlight to each room throughout the day."

Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin were both internationally known lesbian-rights activists with deep roots in the LGBTQ civil rights movement and were also the first same-sex couple to be married in San Francisco in 2004 and in 2008. Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were one of the four couples that founded the Daughters of Bilitis in San Francisco and they often hosted DOB parties and fundraising events in their home during the early years of the organization, when it was a secret group. The first national lesbian-rights organization in the United States, Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), was initially organized as a social group where lesbians could meet and socialize. The organization soon added a newsletter, The Ladder, which became an internationally known magazine, and then to develop a network of local chapters and public biennial conventions on issues of importance to lesbians and gay men. 651 Duncan Street was Lyon’s and Martin’s residence and the place that is most representative of their productive lives as activists, organizers, writers, educators, and icons. As outlined in Citywide Historic Context Statement for LGBTQ History in San Francisco, the Lyon-Martin House is associated with significant events and persons under Theme 4: Homophile Movements (1950s to 1960s). The Daughters of Bilitis, Phyllis Lyon, Del Martin, and “…their home in San Francisco’s Noe Valley neighborhood” are also discussed in the National Park Service’s LGBT America, A Theme Study of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer History."

Designed by master architect Timothy Pflueger of Miller & Pflueger Architects, Roosevelt is one of San Francisco’s most idiosyncratic buildings due to its unique Dutch/German Expressionist styling. It is the only building in San Francisco (and possibly the United States) known to be designed in this avantgarde style. Theodore Roosevelt Middle School is significant for its association with master architect Timothy Pflueger, one of the most talented and influential architects to have worked in San Francisco during the first half of the twentieth century. Roosevelt is also significant for its association with high artistic values, in particular its three well‐preserved New Deal murals, including a pair in the main lobby by Horatio Nelson Poole and one above the second‐floor entrance to the auditorium by George Wilson Walker."

Miller and Timothy L. Pflueger in 1923. The exterior of this monumental banking hall is designed in the Neoclassical style featuring sculpted Greek and Roman-inspired terra cotta ornamentation, fluted columns, a tympanum decorated with figures in relief, and oversized acroteria along its roofline. In its prime, the building was equipped with modern features such as public telephones and was linked to financial centers across the country by private telegraph wires. The building was originally occupied by the Stock Exchange, the nation’s first exchange that specialized in mining stocks. A product of the city’s booming 1920s stock market, the exchange was instrumental in making San Francisco the financial center of the West. In 1927, the name was changed to the Mining Exchange; by 1928 the building was occupied by the Curb Exchange, a securities trading exchange that operated until 1938."

At that time, only the exterior features of the building were designated. In November 2016 the landmark designation was amended to include the double-height, mezzanine-ringed, top-lit circular interior space. Frank Lloyd Wright is by far the most well-know and influential American architect. Although Wright produced several designs for other buildings in San Francisco, the V. C. Morris Gift Shop is the only one that was realized. The V. C. Morris Gift Shop is significant as a rare extant Modern building designed by the master architect."

Brown’s Opera House was built in 1908 and showcased variety acts and vaudeville performances through the 1920s, second run movies during the Depression, Spanish language films in the 1940-50s, and burlesque in the 1960s before it closed in 1970. The building was designed in the Mission Revival style, featuring elaborate arched and quatrefoil windows, twin corner towers, and a decoratively tiled roof parapet. It is the only Mission District live theater still functioning in its original use. The building stands testament to the neighborhood’s history as a thriving entertainment district."

It was a collaborative venture of four prominent architects: Albert A. Schroepfer, Charles F. Strothoff, Martin J. Rist, and Smith O’Brien. With a barrier‐free first floor level, the Sunshine School anticipated by decades the passage of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) of 1968 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style with Moorish and Art Deco detailing, the former Sunshine School is an excellent and well‐preserved public school constructed during the height of San Francisco’s “Golden Age” of school construction."

Goldberg Building is significant as an early 20th century mixed-use building designed with Classically-inspired ornament and containing extraordinarily rare, intact storefronts. On its upper floors, the building features rusticated stucco cladding, bay windows flanked by pilaster panels, molded window surrounds with keystones, and a bracketed cornice and shaped parapet. The ground floor contains three historic storefronts displaying a remarkable state of preservation, including original bulkheads, display windows, vestibule paving, doors, and transom. The storefronts rank among the best preserved storefronts of their age. The property is also significant as the work of master architect, Bernard J. Joseph. The building is named after the Pulitzer-Prize winning cartoonist, sculptor, and author Rueben (Rube) Garnett Lucius Goldberg, and served as Goldberg's San Francisco residence and studio."

Financed by philanthropist James Lick, the bath house had separate men’s and women’s facilities and a distinctive tower that held two large water tanks. Later, a Japanese American family, the Tsukamotos, operated a laundry in the building from 1920-1973. Established during a time of rampant discrimination against Asian immigrants, the business functioned as a point of contact for newly arrived Japanese men and their families."

The house embodies many characteristics of the Italianate villa type, including its portico, tower, cross-gable roof, bracketed cornice, fluted door and window trim, and segmental-arched windows with bracketed hoods. In contrast to the much more common Italianate rowhouse which usually has only one ornamented façade, there is Italianate detailing on three of its four exterior elevations, indicating that it was meant to be appreciated within its landscaped garden setting unobscured by adjoining buildings. It slowly deteriorated as a boarding house in the 1940s through 1950s until 1964 when John and Imogene “Tex” Gieling carefully began restoration."
